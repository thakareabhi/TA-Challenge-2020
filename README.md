# TA Challenge 2020
Skeletons for C Sharp, Java, Javascript and Python, as well as README files for each.

Hello TA Challenge Contestants,

This repository sets out files that should be added to your skeleton repositories as part of answer submission. The repository is split out into four parts:

- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- C#

Each contains a skeleton repository for their respective language. In order to successfully submit solutions for the Challenge, please copy and paste all files for your chosen language into your repository.

The README files contain a brief guide on how to fill in your solutions for the Challenge, before you submit to our central servers through a simple <code>git push</code>.

If there are any questions, you can get in touch with us using the help page at www.codingchallenge.herokuapp.com. 

In the meantime, we wish you all the best of luck as you attempt to be crowned the Global TA Coding Champion!

Kind Regards

GCC Central Team
